## What's the difference from the [original](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) and the [Lua](https://github.com/neanias/everforest-nvim) port?

* Lots of Orange and Red.
  * These colors offer excellent contrast and visual clarity.
* Faster performance.
  * The implementation is simpler and more direct.
  * Colors are assigned straight to highlight groupsâ€”no layers of abstraction.
